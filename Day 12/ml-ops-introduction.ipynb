    "## MLOPS Introduction\n",
    "MLOps is a practice for collaboration and communication between data scientists and operations professionals to help manage the production machine learning lifecycle. This includes production deployment, model monitoring, and health, and managing the model's lifecycle. MLOps applies to the entire lifecycle - from integrating with model training, building CI/CD pipelines, and deploying models to production. \n"

    "### Data Sources\n",
    "Data sources are the sources of data that you use to train your models. These can be databases, data lakes, APIs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Pipelines\n",
    "Data pipelines are the processes that you use to clean, transform, and prepare your data for training. These can be ETL jobs, data processing jobs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Stores\n",
    "Feature stores are the stores that you use to store the features that you use to train your models. These can be databases, data lakes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Training\n",
    "Model training is the process of training your models using the data that you have prepared. This can be done using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation\n",
    "Model evaluation is the process of evaluating the performance of your models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Deployment\n",
    "Model deployment is the process of deploying your models to production so that they can be used to make predictions. This can be done using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Monitoring\n",
    "Model monitoring is the process of monitoring the performance of your models in production. This can be done using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predictions API\n",
    "Predictions API is the API that you use to make predictions using your models. This can be a REST API, gRPC API, etc."

    "1. Use version control for your code and data (e.g., Git\n",
    "2. Use containers for your models (e.g., Docker)\n",
    "3. Use automation for your pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, CircleCI)\n",
    "4. Use monitoring for your models (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)\n",
    "5. Use logging for your models (e.g., ELK stack)\n",
    "6. Use testing for your models (e.g., unit tests, integration tests)\n",
    "7. Use security for your models (e.g., encryption, authentication)\n",
    "8. Use collaboration for your models (e.g., Jupyter notebooks, Slack)\n",
    "9. Use documentation for your models (e.g., README, Wiki)\n",
    "10. Use reproducibility for your models (e.g., DVC, MLFlow)\n",
    "11. Use scalability for your models (e.g., Kubernetes, Spark)\n",
    "12. Use optimization for your models (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, model selection)\n",
    "13. Use deployment for your models (e.g., Kubernetes, Seldon)"
