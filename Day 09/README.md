# DAY 09 - Deep Learninn

## Overview
- Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is concerned with neural networks: how to train and optimize them, and how to use them to make predictions.
- Deep learning is a powerful set of techniques for learning in neural networks.

## Key Concepts
- **Data Imputation**: Data imputation is the process of replacing missing data with substituted values.
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: Artificial Neural Networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.
- **Scaling and Normalization**: Scaling and normalization are important steps in data preprocessing in machine learning.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that is used to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets while preserving as much variance as possible.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Convolutional Neural Networks are a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.
