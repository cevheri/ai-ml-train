   "source": " Dataset is a composite index of military capabilities of a country. It is calculated by adding the values of weighted indicators from three major categories: military capability, force size, and finance. The military capability category is the most heavily weighted, and it includes the number of active personnel, tanks, aircraft, attack helicopters, aircraft carriers, and submarines. The force size category includes the total military personnel, reserve personnel, paramilitary personnel, and the total number of aircraft, helicopters, tanks, and naval assets. The finance category includes the defense budget, external debt, and external financing. The final value is normalized to a value from 0 to 100, with 100 being the best possible score. The index is intended to help governments and analysts assess the military power of a country, and it is not intended to be a definitive assessment of a country's military capabilities. "
