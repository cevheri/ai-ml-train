They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.\\n\\nIn any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small \"Here's The Beef\" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11\" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!\\n\\nWe had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.   \n",

It's very convenient and surrounded by a lot of paths, a desert xeriscape, baseball fields, ballparks, and a lake with ducks.\\n\\nThe Scottsdale Park and Rec Dept. does a wonderful job of keeping the park clean and shaded.  You can find trash cans and poopy-pick up mitts located all over the park and paths.\\n\\nThe fenced in area is huge to let the dogs run, play, and sniff!   \n",

(a few notes: the folks that rated this place low must have been isolated incidences and i feel weigh far to heavy on service rather than product dining at a restaurant rate the service a lil harder but a coffee shop hold your tongue)  anyway this place rocks we arent super close but we pass up several coffee shops en route to lola because the quality is top drawer  the beans fair trade and the roast is perfect the price of a bag of beans is amazing doing right by the farmers and then respecting the product with such a solid roast this is what is all about  i have yet to find a better americano a splash of cream and a splenda only augments the flavor of the espresso and the richness really shines ive been to most of the independent coffee shops throughout the area and if i do find myself elsewhere i can only compare them to lola and lola wins out each time   \n",

       "9994  lets seewhat is there not to like about surprise stadium? well $950 tall cans of pbr is about all i could come up with and thats not a surprise (pun intended) considering youre attending a sporting eventeven spring training   but as someone who does not living in arizona and as someone who doesnt go to mlb baseball games in southern california due to the fact it costs so damn much people bitching about the slow service or any other little inconvenience when it comes to seeing a game here look youre lucky enough to have almost an entire month of low cost mlb baseball right in your back yard if i could id live down here during march just to take in the awesome baseball action that crisscrosses the phoenix metro area each year   i attended my first spring training game on march 12th 2012 at surprise stadium as the royals took on the san francisco giants (my favorite team) our seats (sec 112 row j seats 13-14-15) were 25 bucks each (around 30 bucks including service fees) i mean we were maybe 5 or 6 rows back from the giants dugout (check out some of my pictures) the stadium (funny calling it that since it only holds just over 10000 people) is big enough so you feel youre at an mlb game but small enough to feel pretty close and intimate with the players the stadium is well maintained and kept super clean   arriving to the park i was surprised (pun unintended) to see that parking was free an oddity when going to an event like this the stadium staff as mentioned by other reviews are mainly made up of senior citizens who were super friendly and helpful i didnt have to wait long at the concession stands even if lines were a bit long the outfield is lined with a lawn area perfect for people to sit back and have a picnic while taking in a game (tickets are around 9 bucks each after service fees)   i love this place and hope to return next year when visiting family oh giants won 2-1 go giants   \n",

(a few notes: the folks that rated this place low must have been isolated incidences and i feel weigh far to heavy on service rather than product dining at a restaurant rate the service a lil harder but a coffee shop hold your tongue)  anyway this place rocks we arent super close but we pass up several coffee shops en route to lola because the quality is top drawer  the beans fair trade and the roast is perfect the price of a bag of beans is amazing doing right by the farmers and then respecting the product with such a solid roast this is what is all about  i have yet to find a better americano a splash of cream and a splenda only augments the flavor of the espresso and the richness really shines ive been to most of the independent coffee shops throughout the area and if i do find myself elsewhere i can only compare them to lola and lola wins out each time</td>\n",

       "      <td>lets seewhat is there not to like about surprise stadium? well $950 tall cans of pbr is about all i could come up with and thats not a surprise (pun intended) considering youre attending a sporting eventeven spring training   but as someone who does not living in arizona and as someone who doesnt go to mlb baseball games in southern california due to the fact it costs so damn much people bitching about the slow service or any other little inconvenience when it comes to seeing a game here look youre lucky enough to have almost an entire month of low cost mlb baseball right in your back yard if i could id live down here during march just to take in the awesome baseball action that crisscrosses the phoenix metro area each year   i attended my first spring training game on march 12th 2012 at surprise stadium as the royals took on the san francisco giants (my favorite team) our seats (sec 112 row j seats 13-14-15) were 25 bucks each (around 30 bucks including service fees) i mean we were maybe 5 or 6 rows back from the giants dugout (check out some of my pictures) the stadium (funny calling it that since it only holds just over 10000 people) is big enough so you feel youre at an mlb game but small enough to feel pretty close and intimate with the players the stadium is well maintained and kept super clean   arriving to the park i was surprised (pun unintended) to see that parking was free an oddity when going to an event like this the stadium staff as mentioned by other reviews are mainly made up of senior citizens who were super friendly and helpful i didnt have to wait long at the concession stands even if lines were a bit long the outfield is lined with a lawn area perfect for people to sit back and have a picnic while taking in a game (tickets are around 9 bucks each after service fees)   i love this place and hope to return next year when visiting family oh giants won 2-1 go giants</td>\n",

(a few notes: the folks that rated this place low must have been isolated incidences and i feel weigh far to heavy on service rather than product dining at a restaurant rate the service a lil harder but a coffee shop hold your tongue)  anyway this place rocks we arent super close but we pass up several coffee shops en route to lola because the quality is top drawer  the beans fair trade and the roast is perfect the price of a bag of beans is amazing doing right by the farmers and then respecting the product with such a solid roast this is what is all about  i have yet to find a better americano a splash of cream and a splenda only augments the flavor of the espresso and the richness really shines ive been to most of the independent coffee shops throughout the area and if i do find myself elsewhere i can only compare them to lola and lola wins out each time   \n",

       "4084  lets seewhat is there not to like about surprise stadium? well $950 tall cans of pbr is about all i could come up with and thats not a surprise (pun intended) considering youre attending a sporting eventeven spring training   but as someone who does not living in arizona and as someone who doesnt go to mlb baseball games in southern california due to the fact it costs so damn much people bitching about the slow service or any other little inconvenience when it comes to seeing a game here look youre lucky enough to have almost an entire month of low cost mlb baseball right in your back yard if i could id live down here during march just to take in the awesome baseball action that crisscrosses the phoenix metro area each year   i attended my first spring training game on march 12th 2012 at surprise stadium as the royals took on the san francisco giants (my favorite team) our seats (sec 112 row j seats 13-14-15) were 25 bucks each (around 30 bucks including service fees) i mean we were maybe 5 or 6 rows back from the giants dugout (check out some of my pictures) the stadium (funny calling it that since it only holds just over 10000 people) is big enough so you feel youre at an mlb game but small enough to feel pretty close and intimate with the players the stadium is well maintained and kept super clean   arriving to the park i was surprised (pun unintended) to see that parking was free an oddity when going to an event like this the stadium staff as mentioned by other reviews are mainly made up of senior citizens who were super friendly and helpful i didnt have to wait long at the concession stands even if lines were a bit long the outfield is lined with a lawn area perfect for people to sit back and have a picnic while taking in a game (tickets are around 9 bucks each after service fees)   i love this place and hope to return next year when visiting family oh giants won 2-1 go giants   \n",

(a few notes: the folks that rated this place low must have been isolated incidences and i feel weigh far to heavy on service rather than product dining at a restaurant rate the service a lil harder but a coffee shop hold your tongue)  anyway this place rocks we arent super close but we pass up several coffee shops en route to lola because the quality is top drawer  the beans fair trade and the roast is perfect the price of a bag of beans is amazing doing right by the farmers and then respecting the product with such a solid roast this is what is all about  i have yet to find a better americano a splash of cream and a splenda only augments the flavor of the espresso and the richness really shines ive been to most of the independent coffee shops throughout the area and if i do find myself elsewhere i can only compare them to lola and lola wins out each time</td>\n",
